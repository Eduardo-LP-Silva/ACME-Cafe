## Terminal To Do
- [ ] Receive placed order from NFC or by reading a QR code
- [ ] Send order and vouchers to server (validation on server) and then server sends order number
- [ ] The order can contain one or more of the available menu items and their quantities, and some vouchers appropriate to the order (only one voucher allowed)
- [ ] Check an order - The cafeteria terminals check the orders with the company server, verifying the ‘user id’, the validity and applicability of the appropriate vouchers and the user signature.
- [ ] After validation the app should show order number (in big characters), products ordered, vouchers accepted and total price payed.
- [ ] If all is ok, the terminal calculates and displays an order number (sequential) together with the indication of used vouchers and total price. Otherwise the order is rejected, and that is showed in the terminal by a very visible, large red icon.
